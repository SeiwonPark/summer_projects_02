Multiple Functions with Arduino and Raspberry Pi

**ABSTRACT**

This project was created as a part of the 2020 IoT SMART DESIGN CAMP(2020.08.10 ~ 2020.08.13). In this project, I implemented Multiple Functions(Serial Communication, Sensing and Actuating) between Arduino and Raspberry Pi using Python, C/C++ to automate the circuit and to communicate. And in this process, I tried to control sensors and actuator with only Raspberry Pi. But what I've realized was that Raspberry Pi can't directly control Arduino's actuator but only can receive Serial values. So I regarded Raspberry Pi as an Actuator, and Arduino as a Sensor. The method that was implemented in this project was giving certain values that I set(like 999, 119 or 112) and take those values at a certain condition so that I can divide cases from which sensors gave Raspbery Pi that values.

            <code>%%bash</code>   
            <code>ls /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ | sed "s/^/\/dev\//g"</code>                 
    
## 3. How to use   
### 3.1 Run using <code>main.ipynb</code> in Jupyter Notebook by PL-App Launcher
_Note_: You should make sure that Raspberry Pi uses the same Wi-Fi with your computer   
You can manually run each cell in <code>main.ipynb</code>   

## 4. How it works
